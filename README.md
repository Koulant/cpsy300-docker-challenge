# Introduction to repository
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and resources for completing two Docker challenges. The challenges are designed to help users gain practical experience with Docker, a popular platform used for containerization. The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up the necessary tools, creating Dockerfiles, and running Docker containers to serve static webpages and Node.js applications. The challenges are structured to progressively increase in complexity, starting with serving a simple static webpage and moving on to orchestrating a web server and a Node.js API server using Docker compose.

# Learning experience and findings 
Throughout the process of completing these challenges, I came away with several key findings:
- Docker Basics: The first challenge introduced the fundamental concepts of Docker, including the creation of Dockerfiles and the building of Docker images. This was a foundational step in understanding how Docker can be used to containerize applications.
- Serving Static Webpages: The first challenge demonstrated how Docker can be used to serve static webpages. This involved creating a simple HTML file and using Nginx as a web server within a Docker container. This experience highlighted the versatility of Docker in serving various types of content.
- Node.js Application Containerization: The second challenge focused on containerizing a Node.js application. This involved creating a Dockerfile for the Node.js server and using Docker Compose to manage the orchestration of the web server and the Node.js application. This challenge provided insights into how Docker can be used to containerize more complex applications and manage multi-container applications.
- Docker Compose: The use of Docker Compose in the second challenge was particularly enlightening. It showed how Docker Compose can simplify the management of multi-container applications, making it easier to define and run multiple services together.
- Practical Application: Both challenges provided practical applications of Docker, from serving a simple webpage to orchestrating a web server and a Node.js API server. This hands-on experience was invaluable in understanding the real-world applications of Docker and its role in modern software development practices.

Together, these challenges can provide challengers with a solid foundation of Docker. Personally, I found that completing these practical challenges was fun and helpful in understanding how Docker can be used to containerize applications and manage multi-container applications.
